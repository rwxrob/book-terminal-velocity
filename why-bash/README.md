# Why Bash?

* Bash is the enterprise Linux default, both login and scripting
* Bash is the safest shell available when used properly
* Bash can be easily made POSIX compliant when needed
* Bash GPLv3 licensing issues

## Bash is the enterprise Linux default

*Bash* is the default interactive shell on all enterprise-scale Linux
distributions (Ubuntu, RedHat, SUSe). 

## Bash is the safest shell



Bash is also the safest and most
powerful shell for scripting with double-bracket expansion disabled, and
support for associative arrays, regular expressions, math operators, and
more. It is therefore the first (and potentially only) shell you should
learn.
