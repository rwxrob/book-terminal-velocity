# Only Bash and POSIX Shell Progamming

Before you read much further, I do want to warn those reading who might be hoping to become software developers from this book alone. Sorry, you'll need more, but this is arguably the best start on your path to becoming a *good* software developer.

Every time you hit *Enter* from an interactive terminal command shell you are technically writing one like of code. Therefore, the only programming in *Terminal Velocity* is Bash and POSIX shell scripting.

So, if you are looking up your coding game, I suggest looking for content covering  Python, then Go, then C (to get the best understanding of how computers work) then eventually learning at least minimal Web development with HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript (to understand how networking and the Interwebz works).
