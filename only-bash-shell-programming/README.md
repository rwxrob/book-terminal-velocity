# Only Bash and POSIX Shell Programming

I want to warn those reading who want to become software developers. Sorry, you'll need more than just what you can learn in *Terminal Velocity* but this is arguably the best start on your path to becoming a *good* software developer.

Every time you hit `Enter` from an interactive terminal command shell you are technically writing one line of code. So there *is* code in here, just Bash and POSIX shell scripting, which some might argue are not the best first languages a beginning software developer should learn. 

If you are concerned with making the best first-coding impression on yourself you might consider learning programming basics in another language first (before reading *Terminal Velocity*) or just reading enough to get good with editing files and switch to learning your preferred first language.

What language should you learn first?

I've helped thousands to learn coding and my personal (unscientific but informed) opinion has been that learning Python, then Go, then C gives the strongest foundation upon which to build everything else. Then, eventually, everyone should learn minimal Web development with HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript to understand how networking and the Interwebz works. From there the sky's the limit. PHP, Java, Kotlin, Swift, C++, Rust, Haskell, Erlang, Crystal, Julia, even Perl, Lisp, Fortran, and COBOL are all very viable languages solving very interesting --- and different --- problems in the world.

I realize those recommendations are likely not what you are hearing from others. Learning Web development as the first (and only) type of "software development" is extremely common, but incomplete if you want to gain full understanding. You can always leverage your terminal mastery skills to be a much better Web developer (as many popular streamers and YouTubers do) even if you decide later to just do Web development.

::: Rant

Please don't call yourself a "software engineer" if all you've learned to code are Web applications. It confuses people and is actually illegal in Canada where the title "engineer" is reserved for people with the proper training, like "electrician" or "doctor." Linus Torvaldz, Linux inventors, refuses to refer to Web developers as "developers" at all, which is farther than I would go, but just so you know.
