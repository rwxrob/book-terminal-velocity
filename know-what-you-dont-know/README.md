# Know What You Don't Know

The hardest part of learning anything is learning what you need to learn
in the first place. Rather than provide comprehensive coverage of
everything relevant to this content very often I simply point you in the
right direction and send you on your way to go learn whatever is needed.
The `bash` scripting language, for example, is huge. Covering all of it
would be very unnecessary --- especially since `man bash` is a
searchable, definitive guide to everything you ever need to learn about
`bash`. When combined with `shellcheck` you have all the comprehensive
resources you need at your fingertips, literally, and without a
dependency on the Internet at all.
