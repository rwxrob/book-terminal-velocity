# Content Organization and Style

Content is organized to be consumable in many ways:

* GitHub `README.md` files
* Rendered web site with persistent, unique slug references
* ePub from usual sources (Amazon, Barnes & Noble, etc.)
* PDF
* KEG Node

## Flat Directory Structure

If you are reading this from the source code than you already know all
the content is organized into a single, flat directory structure with
all the directory names matching slugs from the web version. This flat
structure enables browsing from GitHub `README.md` files without breaking
link navigation.

## Blog-Post Length Restriction

Good science suggests the optimal length for a blog post is 2000-3000
words. This turns out to be about the same length of content most people
can read while on a typical break.

## First-Person, Friendly, Casual Voice

I write best when imagining myself having a conversation with another
*actual* person, a friend I just happen to be helping, perhaps. I'm sure
more than a decade of doing exactly that has created this habit in me.

We humans are weird. We begin to mimic the pace and style of
communication of the person we whom we are interacting. Some people
(like my wife) will even begin to mouth the words of the other person,
so amazing. I sure hope so, because there is no reason to get stressed
over any of this stuff. We want to have fun --- no seriously --- *lots*
of fun because you learn better when your Dopamine levels are high
(look it up, I swear). We are going to really screw some things up, and
laugh all along the way.

Anyway.

Since I can't interact with you directly the best alternative is this
casual, familiar, first-person voice I'm using right now to write this.

I'm sure you get enough unnecessarily verbose, over-priced, bombast in
those text books you are forced to buy. (Someone slap me if any of that
unscientific, foolishness creeps in here.)

## Beware, Strong Opinions Ahead

> Strong opinions, weakly/weekly held.

The tech world is currently plagued by a lack of strong, informed
opinions. There's nothing more frustrating to a beginner than not having
a "one best option" picked out for them.

Not here with me. Imma tell you what I think and why and ask you to go
with it for a while until you have enough experience to supplement or
replace what you've learned with me, you know, like with Mr. Miyagi,
"wax on, wax off." There are other mentors out there, to be sure.
Nothing wrong with that at all. But I do have my preferred style and
strong opinions.

Beginners of the martial arts dedicate themselves to learning a
particular style fully (usually from the same sensei) before moving on
to others. Learning tech is not unlike this, and learning to be
primarily proficient in the terminal (over GUI) is similar to learning a
very lethal form over common self-defense tactics. Will it take longer
to master? Yes, but not by as much as you might think, and the reward of
empowerment help you at every level of your tech career, or just life in
general. Tech is for artists and creatives as well.
