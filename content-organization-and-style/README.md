# Content Organization and Style

Content is organized to be consumable in many ways:

* GitHub `README.md` files
* Rendered web site with persistent, unique slug references
* ePub from usual sources (Amazon, Barnes & Noble, etc.)
* PDF
* KEG Node

The goal is to have the knowledge source as consumable as any of the
rendered versions, a tradition started by Jon Gruber and Aaron Swartz
when they created Markdown.

* [Flat Directory Structure](/flat-directory-structure)
* [Optimal Blog Length](/optimal-blog-length)
* [First Person, Friendly, Casual Voice](/first-person-friendly-casual-voice/)
* [Beware, Strong Opinions Ahead](/beware-strong-opinions-ahead)
* [Know What You Don't Know](/know-what-you-dont-know)
