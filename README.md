# ðŸ“•Terminal Velocity: Mastering the Fastest Human-Computer Interface

Wanna become a terminal master? This is the way.

*Terminal Velocity* is a free[^1] collection of tutorials, tips, and tricks used by long-time UNIX terminal users to help you master the most powerful and ubiquitous terminal commands available today. It's not enough to just learn these commands. You need to understand what they are good for and why, how deeply each needs to be understood, how do they work together, how to apply the UNIX philosophy to combine them together in truly mind-blowing ways.

*Terminal Velocity* also responses to challenges like "Why use a terminal at all?" (spoiler alert: it's not just because terminal users are "old and backward"); and "Why not use this other command?" Having these answers reduces subjective debate giving you more time to do productive things with nothing but a terminal and a keyboard (as well as when AFK).
