# ðŸ“• Terminal Velocity: Mastering the Fastest Human-Computer Interface

*Terminal Velocity* is first and foremost an online knowledge base of
tips and tricks for becoming your best self when faced with a UNIX (or
Linux) terminal. This also just so happens to be a book.

## TL;DR

Learn to use the UNIX terminal interface with the least amount of
installation and setup possible --- specifically, vim, bash,
screen/tmux, lynx/w3m, and docker/podman. We'll follow the UNIX
philosophy when editing files, creating tools, and doing research.
Eventually, you'll be 10 times faster than those who depend on
cumbersome graphic user interfaces for most of the same tasks.
